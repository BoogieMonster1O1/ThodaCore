# Thoda Core

The backend.

## Overview

Thoda Core is written in Swift and uses Vapor as the server framework with GraphQL APIs. The backend relies on a PostgreSQL database for persistent data storage and Redis for caching and token management.

- Thoda Core adopts GraphQL to provide a flexible and efficient API.
- Data is stored in a PostgreSQL database.
- Redis is employed for caching purposes.

## Compatibility
Thoda Core is designed to run seamlessly on Linux and macOS operating systems. However, it does not support Windows.

## Synopsis
Thoda Core serves as the backend for an unnamed exclusive social media platform for RVCE students. While it has been created for the experience, it is not yet intended for widespread usage. Feel free to explore this social space tailored to our college community.
